## Fix My Code Challenge

The "Fix My Code Challenge" project involves diving into an existing codebase and fixing errors without rewriting the entire project from scratch. The code might be written in a language you know or don't, adding an extra layer of challenge. The goal is to improve the code and make it functional without changing its main structure.

## Key features of the project:

## Spot fixes: 
The focus is on identifying and correcting specific errors, not a complete overhaul.
Diverse languages: Sometimes the code will be in a language you know, but other times you'll need to research or learn the basics to solve the problem.
## README.md file:
A README.md file is required at the root of the project to document any changes or additional instructions.
Editor usage: Editors like vi, vim, or emacs are allowed.
Operating system: The code will be compiled and executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.
## Optional:
The project is entirely optional and will not negatively impact your grade, but it can boost your average if you achieve a good result.

The focus is on learning to debug and fix errors quickly in different languages and contexts, which will help you improve your skills as a developer.
